    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello 
        My name is Areen saleh jaradat.
        I lives in Irbid, I like to take picture, programming language and travel but I doesn’t travel yet. Went to Jordan university of science and technology in compute engineering field it’s not like what I thought it’s a big world and nor easy, I was very interested in some subject but some subject was like killing me, I learned many languages like C#, C++, and JAVA, after graduated I have seen the university not enough to have a job, then looking for chances to strength my skills and my knowledge, so ,learned a course of CCNA, then the COVID19 appeared we sat in our homes I was disappointed but still looking for online Like python course, then I have seen this program and apply to it ,it match what I need and I am so glad to have it ,I hope to complete with this program till the end then have great job , I don’t want to be a person who doesn’t ambitions and dreams have.
    </p>
